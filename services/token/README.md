# Token Issuance Service

### How to create

It is created by FundersToken.

### Basic usage

1. Anyone can create its own **Smart Token** and **Corporate Account Entity** by consuming **FIL** (FundersToken Initialisation License) and **FST Service Gas** for Token Issuance Service.
2. **FIL** is for checking the license, and **FST Service Gas** is for paying the commission of the `totalSupply` of the **Smart Token**.
