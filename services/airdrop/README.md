# Airdrop Escrow Box Service 

### How to create

It is created by FundersToken.

### Basic usage

1. Only the issuers can create `AirdropMission`.
2. The issuers have to assign the **Smart Asset**, the budget (transfer the **Smart Asset** to the Airdrop Escrow Box Service) and the invoke time of the `AirdropMission`.
3. FundersToken will invoke the `AirdropMission` once the invoke time is reached.
